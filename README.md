<br/>I also used xander1998's RequestNetworkControl function to control the pet ped, so thanks to him for that.

# Description
I decided to write a server synced version of this script to use for fun with my friends. Originally, I posted this without server.lua and
people thought that this script didn't work. It does work and now I have updated it, so that it is separated into its files and made additional
improvements to this script.

If anyone wants to improve this script further, feel free to and make a commit if you want the changes to be merged.

# Download Instructions
Either clone this repository and create a folder for it in the resources folder in your FiveM server. Then configure your server to start
this resource.

Or you may get a zipped version at the releases tab of this repository and extract it into your resources folder.
